# Error Fix Summary - BadMethodCallException

## Problem
`Call to undefined method App\Models\BusinessMetric::records()`

## Root Cause
BusinessMetric model memiliki relationship `metricRecords()` tetapi FeedsController menggunakan `records()`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added alias method in BusinessMetric model
```php
// Alias for records() method used in feeds
public function records()
{
    return $this->metricRecords();
}
```

### 2. Fixed scope calls in FeedsController
Changed `->active()` to `->where('is_active', true)` because Business model doesn't have active scope.

### 3. Fixed views to use correct relationships
- Updated profile.blade.php
- Updated dashboard-feeds/index.blade.php

### 4. Added Activity Logging
- Import/create metrics now logs activity
- Data input records now log activity
- Enhanced activity tracking system

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The application should now work without the BadMethodCallException error.

## Test Steps
1. Login as admin
2. Import metrics - should work without error
3. Navigate to dashboard feeds - should load without error
4. Input data in metrics - should create activity logs
5. View activity timeline in feeds page

## Additional Improvements
- Enhanced activity logging system
- Better error handling
- Consistent relationship usage across models and controllers
